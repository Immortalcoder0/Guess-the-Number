# **Number Guessing Game** ðŸŽ²  

Welcome to my first project created in C â€“ a **Number Guessing Game**! This simple yet fun game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number.  

## **About the Project**  
The Number Guessing Game demonstrates:  
- Basic concepts of C programming, such as random number generation, loops, and conditionals.  
- An interactive console-based application designed for a great learning experience.  

## **Features**  
- Random number generation for dynamic gameplay.  
- Tracks player attempts to guess the number.  
- Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.  

## **How to Run**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Immortalcoder0/Guess-the-Number.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd Guess-the-Number/Project/  
   ```  
3. Compile the code:  
   ```bash  
   gcc main.c -o Guess_the_number 
   ```  
4. Run the program:  
   ```bash  
   ./Guess_the_number  
   ```  

## **Future Plans**  
I plan to enhance the game by adding:  
- Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
